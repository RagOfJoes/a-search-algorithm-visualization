# a-search-algorithm-visualization
My implementation of the A* Search Algorithm onto a drawable grid system. 
## Controls: 
- Left Click - Create obstacles | Create Start and End Cells once Space Bar has been pressed
- Right Click - Remove obstacles, Start cells, and End cells
- Space Bar - Engage/Disengage ability to create obstacles
- R Key - Will run the algorithm once Start and End Cells are placed
## Future plans
- Reset Button
- Customizable colors!
- A way to determine that End Cell is unreachable
## What I took away from this project was...
- A better understanding of the A* Search Algorithm
- A way to effectively implement the insertion sort method
- Appreciation and realization of how significant encapsulation is to optimizing a program
