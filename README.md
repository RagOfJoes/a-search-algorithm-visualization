# a-search-algorithm-visualization
My implementation of the A* Search Algorithm onto a drawable grid system. 
## Controls: 
- Left Click - Create obstacles | Create and Remove Start Cells when SpaceBar is pressed
- Right Click - Remove obstacles | Create and Remove End Cells when SpaceBar is pressed
- R Key - Will run the algorithm once Start and End Cells are placed
- BackSpace - Reset entire board
## What I took away from this project was...
- A better understanding of the A* Search Algorithm
- A way to effectively implement the insertion sort method
- Appreciation and realization of how significant encapsulation is to optimizing a program
